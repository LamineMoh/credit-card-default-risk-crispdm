# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
Understand the dataset structure, data quality, class imbalance, and key variables related to credit default risk.

## Dataset Overview
- Number of observations: 30,000
- Target variable: default.payment.next.month
- Feature types: demographic, financial, payment history

## Initial Checks
- Data types and missing values
- Class distribution (default vs non-default)
- Summary statistics

## Key Questions
- Is the dataset imbalanced?
- Which variables show strong relationship with default?
- Are there anomalies or extreme values?

## Next Steps
Results from this EDA will guide data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection.
