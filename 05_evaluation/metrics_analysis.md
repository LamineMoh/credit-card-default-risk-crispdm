# Model Evaluation – Metrics Analysis

## Objective
Evaluate model performance using metrics aligned with credit risk management.

## Metrics Used
- Recall (primary metric)
- Precision
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Rationale
In credit risk, false negatives (undetected defaults) have a high financial cost.  
Therefore, recall is prioritized over accuracy.

## Interpretation
Model performance is analyzed in terms of risk reduction and decision impact.
