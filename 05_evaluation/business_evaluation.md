# Business Evaluation

HEAD
## Cost-Sensitive Analysis
A cost matrix was defined to reflect the asymmetric cost of prediction errors.

- False Negative: High financial loss
- False Positive: Moderate opportunity cost

Lowering the decision threshold reduced overall estimated business losses,
despite an increase in false positives.

## Recommendation
Adopt a recall-oriented threshold in production systems,
with regular monitoring of business impact.
=======
## Business Impact
The selected model helps identify high-risk clients earlier, reducing potential financial losses.

## Decision Support
Model outputs can support:
- Credit approval decisions
- Credit limit adjustments
- Early intervention strategies

## Limitations
- Historical dataset
- No real-time behavioral data
- Class imbalance constraints
