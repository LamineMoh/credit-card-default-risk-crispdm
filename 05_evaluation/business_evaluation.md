# Business Evaluation

## Cost-Sensitive Analysis
A cost matrix was defined to reflect the asymmetric cost of prediction errors.

- False Negative: High financial loss
- False Positive: Moderate opportunity cost

Lowering the decision threshold reduced overall estimated business losses,
despite an increase in false positives.

## Recommendation
Adopt a recall-oriented threshold in production systems,
with regular monitoring of business impact.
