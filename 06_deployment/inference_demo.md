# Inference Demo

## Objective
Demonstrate how the trained model can be used to predict default risk for new clients.

## Inference Process
- Load trained model
- Preprocess new input data
- Generate default probability
- Apply decision threshold

## Deployment Perspective
This workflow can be integrated into a credit decision system or exposed via an API.

## Monitoring Considerations
- Model performance drift
- Data distribution changes
- Periodic retraining
